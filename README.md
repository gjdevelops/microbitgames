# Micro:Bit games
These are games that can run on a microbit!   
There are currently 2 games right now, so if you would like to play them, follow the instructions below!

About the game we call "MicroBird:" This is a game where you are able to move your character up and down using the A and B buttons while trying to avoid obstacles that come toward you. Every obstacle you pass, you get a point. To turn it on, press A+B at the same time. Once you hit an obstacle or turn off the game, it displays your score and will turn off.

About the game we call "MicroPVP:" This is a game where you need 2 players to play. A and B will move your character up and down, and you are able to shoot projectiles at the other player by shaking the device. Your character is displayed on the left of your screen, and your opponent's character is on the right. To turn it on and off, press A+B at the same time. Make sure you and your partner turn it on at the same time, as there may be some glitches otherwise. Remember that you have to be pretty close to each other, micro:bits can't connect to each othr from a long distance.

How to play:
First, there should be a "download .zip" button, click and download.  
Then, go to the folder that you downloaded the file in, look for it.  
Once you find it, right click, click extract, and the .hex files should be there in a seperate folder.
Plug in your microbit into your computer, drag and drop which games you want to play, turn on the microbit, and have fun!
